= Guide to user defined commands

User defined commands let you add custom commands to the Spring CLI.
The directory structure commands represents the command and sub-command that are introduced into the shell.

A directory structure of `controller\new` translates to the command `controller new` in the CLI.

Files located in the sub-command directory contains a description of the command and action files that describe what content to add to the project.
User defined commands are registered with the CLI using the command
```
command add --from <repository-url>
```
The contents of that repository are copied into your existing project.

== Structure

The directory structure for all user defined commands are under the path

```
.spring/commands
```
So for a hypothetical user defined command `controller new` the full directory structure where the command description file and action files are located would be
```
.spring/commands/controller/new
```
