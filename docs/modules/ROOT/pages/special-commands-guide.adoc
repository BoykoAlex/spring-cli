= Special Commands

Special commands are part of a command group named `.`

== Execute OS Shell command

The command `. !` executes an OS command in the directory where you started the shell.
This command only works in interactive mode.

If you are having difficulty executing the command, you may want to try surrounding it with double quotes, though then you would likely need to replace any double quotes within your command with single quotes.
It can get funky, so don't push this functionality too far, in practice it works well with common day-to-day tasks.

For Unix/Mac it executed using `bash -c` and for Windows using `cmd /c`.
