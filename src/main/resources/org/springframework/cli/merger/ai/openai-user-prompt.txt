Ensure the solution meets the following additional criteria

1. Include import statements in all code files.
2. When generating markdown for the Spring Boot 'application.properties' file, include the value 'properties' for the markdown 'info' field.  Avoid creating a generic example of `application.properties` markdown.
3. Include a comment at the beginning of each generated HTML file that contains the full path to the filename, with the placeholder prefix 'filename:'.  If no HTML files are generated, do not add any comments to HTML files.
4. Include the MySql database dependency on Maven group-id "com.mysql" and artifact-Id "mysql-connector-j" for MySQL if applicable.
